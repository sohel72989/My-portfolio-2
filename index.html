                    to let your mind wander and take stock. Traveling is one of the best ways to learn more about
                    yourself.
                    Every day traveling brings a new set of issues and opportunities. The way you handle those also

                    insight into who you are. Youâ€™ll come home knowing yourself better, and with a fresh perspective on
                    what
                    you
                    want out of life. The experience will change your life.</p>

                <p>
                    Working from home is a lot more comfortable for lots of people. Employees can save a great deal of
                    time and money since they do not have to travel so often, which means people will have more time for
                    work and for themselves, too. Less travelling will also help reduce traffice jam and pollutants to
                    our environment. Besides, working at home does not mean staying inside all day long, people can
                    choose to work in their garden or backyard, wherever makes them feel convenient to work. Moreover,
                    employees are under less stresses since they get to decide when to work and when to take rest. These
                    things will help giving out better perfomance to tasks.</p>

                <p>There are still some disadvantages that home-working could bring. For instance, working from personal
                    space will reduce direct interactions among colleagues. But the problem is solved thanks to the
                    Internet. As for now, people from around the globe can easily contact and work with others from
                    distances. Another drawback is that some people may get distracted from work by external factors.
                    This requires employees to be highly awared of what they should and should not do for their paid
                    jobs.

                    In conclusion, working from home should be encouraged because the advantages overcome the
                    disadvantages.</p>
